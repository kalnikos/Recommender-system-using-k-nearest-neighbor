# Recommender system using k-nearest neighbor technique

In this project I tried to create some tools in order to help a general manager to build a basketball team with the features that he needs. I split the project in to parts, at the first part I created a recommendation model which present players to the manager based on the features that he defined  and at the second part, I tried to build a prediction model aiming to predict the position of the player based on specific features.

I created the recommendation model using the K nearest neighbour technique. I started with the hypothesis that us a general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks I was looking for a good fit for Antentokoumbo in order to win the championship. Giannis has a very strong skill package but needs more players to support him. 

Giannis needs a player that can create for him and also utilizes his creative ability. So I am looking for a young ambitious players with offensive skills
