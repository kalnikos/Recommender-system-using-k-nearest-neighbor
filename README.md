# Recommender system using k-nearest neighbor technique

In this project I tried to create some tools in order to help a general manager to build a basketball team with the features that he needs. I split the project in two parts, at the first part I created a recommendation model which present players to the manager based on the features that he defined  and at the second part, I tried to build a prediction model aiming to predict the position of the player based on specific features.

I created the recommendation model using the K nearest neighbour technique. I started with the hypothesis that us a general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks I was looking for a good fit for Antentokoumbo in order to win the championship. Giannis has a very strong skill package but needs more players to support him. 

Giannis needs a player that can create for him and also utilizes his creative ability. So I am looking for a young ambitious players with offensive skills.

I started my searching with these features: age=27, 3P%=0.40, 3PA=6, 2P%=0.45, AST=6, TOV=3 and I specify the number of neighbors as 3. The model recommend three players and one of them is currently Giannis teammate. Despite that Middleton is  a nice shooting guard I tried to make my search more specific in order to pick a point guard.

From the column position I convert the categorical variables into dummy variables and also in my second target group I add the salary feature. The recommendation results were interesting, the first player was Malcom Brogdon former Giannis teammate that Milwaukee chose to trade, the second one was Terry Rozier a player with potentials who had a great playoff series last year against Bucks. The third prediction wasn’t a point guard however the recommandations were acceptable.

At the second part I created a model aiming to predict the player position. I tried firstly to create the model using a small data set using two different 
More comprehensive the model’s Accuracy metrics are:


•	K nearest Neighbor: Train set Accuracy:  0.85, 
The best Test accuracy was 0.78 with k= 9 
And the F1 Scores [0.84790528, 0.46827133, 0.84401914]


•	Logistic Regression: Train set Accuracy: 0.75
Test set Accuracy:  0.74
F1 Scores ([0.82362941, 0.24148607, 0.82871422])
